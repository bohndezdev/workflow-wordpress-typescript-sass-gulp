# workflow-wordpress-typescript-sass-gulp
Workflow to develop wordpress projects with Typescript, Sass (scss). I use Gulp to bundle code and run tasks.


## Dependencies
You need some dependencies installed for develop:
- Local server like:
  - MAMP
  - WAMP
  - XAMPP
- PHP in that server
- Nodejs in your machine

## How to start
Get the whole files of this proyect and place them in the root of your wordpress proyect.

Take care with the hidden files:
- .babelrc
- browserslistrc
- .gitignore (You can replace it if you want)

For __".git"__ file. You might want to have your own, I recomend you not copy it.


### Develop
```
npm install
npm start
```
